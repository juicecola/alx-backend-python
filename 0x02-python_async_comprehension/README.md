0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
Async comprehensions are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allow you to use asynchronous code in a concise and expressive way when creating iterables like lists, sets, and dictionaries. Similar to regular comprehensions, async comprehensions provide a compact syntax to generate and collect items, but with the added capability of using await within them.
